The flow is started using a Timeout Notification node which is configured to fire a flow propagation on an automatic regular basis after a fixed interval of time. The second node in the flow is a trace node which appends text to a trace file to record the time when the trace node was reached, the interval for flow propagation and the message count. After observing the flow in operation, the tutorial reconfigures the flow to use a Policy which defines the configuration of the time period interval between the flow propagations. Policies can be referred to from one or more flows, and redeployed to reconfigure the behavior of the flow."

If you were to extend this scenario to use a TimeoutNotification node which uses the Controlled operation mode, then a queue manager would be required. In this situation, information about the state of in-flight messages would be held on storage queues that are controlled by IBM MQ. If you were using timeout flows on an independent integration server, and your TimeoutNotification node uses the Controlled operation mode, then you can choose to use either a local default queue manager or a remote default queue manager. Interactions between an independent integration server and IBM MQ can use a client connection to a remote default queue manager. If you were using timeout flows on a node owned integration server, and your TimeoutNotification node uses the Controlled operation mode, then this means that you must install IBM MQ on the same computer as your integration node and use a local queue manager."
